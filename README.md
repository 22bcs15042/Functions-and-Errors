# Functions and Errors



The MyToken smart contract is an implementation of a simple token system on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract is written in Solidity version ^0.8.0, and it encapsulates basic token functionalities including minting, burning, and transferring tokens. It also incorporates several advanced features such as error handling and event logging to ensure transparency and robustness.

Contract Overview
Contract Name: MyToken

This contract models a basic fungible token with a customizable name and symbol. It allows the creation (minting) of new tokens, destruction (burning) of existing tokens, and the transfer of tokens between users.

State Variables
address private owner;

Purpose: Stores the Ethereum address of the contract creator or owner. This address has special privileges to mint and burn tokens.
string public name = "simple";

Purpose: Represents the name of the token. Here, it is set to "simple", but this can be customized as per requirements.
string public symbol = "SIMP";

Purpose: Represents the token’s symbol or ticker. It is a shorthand identifier for the token, set to "SIMP" in this contract.
uint public totalSupply = 0;

Purpose: Tracks the total number of tokens that exist in the system. This value increases when tokens are minted and decreases when tokens are burned.
mapping(address => uint) public balances;

Purpose: Maps each address to its respective token balance. This mapping allows for efficient querying of user balances.
Events
event Mint(address indexed to, uint amount);

Purpose: Emitted when new tokens are minted. It logs the recipient address and the amount of tokens minted, providing transparency and traceability for the minting operations.
event Burn(address indexed to, uint amount);

Purpose: Emitted when tokens are burned. It records the address from which tokens were burned and the amount burned, helping to track the reduction in total supply.
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);

Purpose: Emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another. This event includes the sender address, receiver address, and the amount transferred, facilitating monitoring and verification of transactions.
Errors
error InsufficientBalance(uint balance, uint withdrawAmount);
Purpose: A custom error used to handle scenarios where an attempt is made to burn more tokens than the account holds. This error provides a clear indication of the issue, including the current balance and the requested burn amount.
Modifiers
modifier onlyOwner
Purpose: Restricts access to certain functions, allowing only the contract owner to execute them. This is critical for functions like mint and burn, ensuring that only authorized users can alter the token supply.
Constructor
constructor()
Purpose: Initializes the contract, setting the owner variable to the address that deployed the contract. This ensures that the deployer has exclusive rights to mint and burn tokens.
Functions
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public onlyOwner

Purpose: Allows the owner to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
Logic:
Validation: Not applicable since it’s restricted to the owner by the onlyOwner modifier.
Actions:
Increases the totalSupply by the _value amount.
Updates the balances mapping for the specified address by adding _value tokens.
Emits the Mint event to log the minting operation.
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public onlyOwner

Purpose: Enables the owner to destroy tokens from a specified address, thus reducing the total token supply.
Logic:
Validation: Checks if the balance of _address is less than _value. If so, it reverts the transaction with an InsufficientBalance error.
Actions:
If the balance is sufficient, decreases totalSupply by _value.
Subtracts _value from the balances of _address.
Emits the Burn event to log the burning operation.
function transfer(address _receiver, uint _value) public

Purpose: Allows any token holder to transfer tokens to another address.
Logic:
Validation: Ensures that the sender’s balance is at least _value. If not, the transaction is reverted with a failure message.
Actions:
Deducts _value tokens from the sender’s balance.
Adds _value tokens to the receiver’s balance.
Emits the Transfer event to record the transaction.
